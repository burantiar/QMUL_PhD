In order to make smart home enterprises enter the era of Smart Home 2.0, it is necessary to consider the elements related to smart home platforms. This study examines the relationship between consumers' value perception and the platform ecosystem theory and how this relationship contributes to their perception of smart home products' value. This study aims to reveal the influence of smart home platform elements on the value perception of consumers regarding consumers' perception of the smart home products' value. To achieve this goal, an online survey (n = 595) was implemented to collect data from Japanese respondents. The analytical results presented in this study indicated that consumers, who sense the value of modularization of smart home products and inter-consumer connectivity, can sense the value of smart home products. In addition, consumers who can perceive the value of a platform service can indirectly feel the value of smart home products through modularity and inter-consumer connectivity. The results presented in this study provide new insights into product development in Smart Home 2.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,21,21,,,,,,,7391,10.3390/s21217391,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21217391,,,,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",,Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Where the initial goal of the emergence of the concept of a smart home is to create home automation that can increase the comfort of its residents. Smart home technology enables communication between household appliances and users and improves automation, monitoring and remote-control capabilities. Various studies have been conducted to develop smart home technology. The main purpose of developing a smart home is to meet human needs, namely, to increase user comfort and make everyday life easier. In its development, there are several aspects in a smart home that must be met, namely Security and Safety, Energy Management, and Comfort Control. In various countries have started implementing smart home simulators as learning media, various studies also show that the use of simulators can help in understanding a technology. But until now, in Indonesia, there is still no simulator/trainer who can facilitate learning about smart home technology. Therefore it is necessary to develop intelligent home prototypes that are integrated into one product to facilitate this learning. In this case, context-aware technology is a solution that can be used in the development of a smart green building. Technology context-aware is a term for a smart home that has the intelligence to automate home devices based on the context of the occupants.

As the world is driving more and more closer to adopting smart cities based infrastructural environments, in which most activities involve innovative technological connectivity, smart home automation is one of the focused areas which has grown exponentially in the last few decades. The main objective of smart home automation is to make life easier and convenient for homeowners and users. The role of smart home automation is essential to healthcare and the social and economic well-being of all users through the provision of a convenient and conducive place of living. With the spontaneous evolution of new trends in smart home automation design, the various elements and functions of devices used in building smart home systems need to be explained as these technologies have significant benefits. They can assist traditional methods of controlling and monitoring home appliances, improve healthcare for the elderly and disabled, alert homeowners in case of potential risk and enable homes to be controlled even while the owner is far from home. Most importantly, smart home systems have great potential for reduction in energy loss. Furthermore, to provide valuable insights into these technological environments, we must clearly understand some of the available options and gaps in the area of smart home automation systems. This paper presents a taxonomy of IoT smart home automation systems with elaborate discussions on the technologies, trends and challenges in smart home automation system design.

Nonetheless, the participating of third-party SDKs and management systems complicates the workflow of such devices. If not meticulously assessed, the complex workflow often leads to the violation of privacy and security to both the consumer and the manufacturer. In this paper, we illustrate how the security and privacy of smart home devices are affected by JoyLink, a widely used smart home solution. We demonstrate a concrete analysis combined with network traffic interception, source code audit, and binary code reverse engineering to evince that the design of smart home solution is error-prone.

The focus of China's policies on smart home for elderly care were different during those four developmental stages. Compared with Western countries, China's smart home for elderly care is a policy-driven product rather than technology-driven or demand-driven one. In addition, it is quasi-public goods rather than private goods. These unique characteristics of China's smart home for elderly care not only become the driving force of its rapid development, but also bring many challenges to its development, such as the insufficient demand, the disorderly development, and the waste of public and private resources. Conclusions Although great progress has been made in China's smart home care, much efforts are still needed to further advance its development. The technical standards for the elderly care services should be formulated as soon as possible and the existing public and private smart home for elderly care platforms should be combined.

The technology used at home has changed significantly over the past several decades, leading to what is known today as the smart home. However, this growth has also brought new challenges to our home security and privacy. With the smart home becoming more mainstream, cybersecurity issues have become a fundamental concern. The smart home is an environment where heterogeneous devices and appliances are interconnected through the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide smart services to residents. These services include home climate control, energy management, video on demand, music on-demand, remote healthcare, remote control, and other similar services in a ubiquitous manner. Smart home devices can be controlled via the Internet using smartphones. However, connecting smart home appliances to wireless networks and the Internet makes individuals vulnerable to malicious attacks. Remote access within the same environment or over the Internet requires an effective access control mechanism.

We design several attacks including cyber-physical system attacks and advanced cyber attacks, and then evaluate their impact via practical evaluations. Our proposed offensive techniques are based on the following current smart home status: (1) almost every smart home appliance is directly or indirectly connected to the Internet for remote monitoring and/or control. (2) there are Internet services that integrate heterogeneous devices into one single smart home environment. These integration services make it easy and simple to build any form of customised smart home configurations. However, at the same time, such services also put the smart home at risk when they are compromised and abused by attackers, which means that the attackers can achieve their goals without needing to compromise individual smart home devices. Our evaluation results show that using traditional web attack techniques such as cookie stealing can be turned into sophisticated attacks that enable the attackers to perform various malicious activities such as unlocking the smart lock installed at the target premises and disarming security alarms.

With the advance of technology, homeowners are able to control and monitor their home through the smartphone or other networked device. However, it was discovered that Malaysians are highly reluctant in adopting smart home concept and similar Internet of Things (IoT). Within the smart home market, there were cases where potential home buyer may be unaware of the technology, thus hinder its adoption and further development. This research aims to investigate the awareness of potential home buyers specifically among the young millennials on smart home concept; perception on the factors influencing them to buy and key features that they will consider in buying a smart home. Questionnaire survey has been conducted and descriptive analysis has been used to analyse the data. Findings showed that the knowledge on smart home concept is still low among the target population. Respondents with the intention to buy smart home has chosen 'saving energy, time and money' as the main factor influencing while 'wireless lighting system' as the key features that taken into consideration. These findings may encourage the adoption of the smart home concept among the Millennia Generation in Malaysia and therefore intensify its development in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,849,,,,,,,,12055,10.1088/1757-899X/849/1/012055,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/849/1/012055,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Smart home control systems such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home provide user interfaces to coordinate the operation of several home appliances. While this facilitate integrating the operations of several appliances, system integrators still need to specify and define the integration and communication logic. This logic depends on both the appliance and the control system providers. This paper introduces SmartHomeML, a domain specific modelling language for smart home applications, that allows users to define new skills (functionalities). SmartHomeML consists of a model designer that supports modelling smart home applications and a model generator that uses template-based transformation to automatically generate smart home device adapters and connectors that conform to the specification of a selected target home control system. We show through an example how to use SmartHomeML to model a smart home service independently from the target smart home provider and then generate Amazon Alexa Skill Adapters and SmartThings SmartApps automatically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,82,88,,10.1109/IEEE.ICIOT.2017.35,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEEE.ICIOT.2017.35,,,,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",,Computer Science; Engineering,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Smart technologies make it possible to monitor, control and support residents, which can enhance the quality life and promote independent living. To facilitate the implementation and adoption of smart home technology it is important to examine the user's perspective and the current state of smart homes. Given the fast pace with which the literature has been developing in this area, there is a strong need to revisit the literature. The aim of this paper is to systematically review the smart home literature and survey the current state of play from the users' perspective. After discussing the systematic methodology, the review presents a comprehensive view of smart home definitions and characteristics. Then the study turns towards a discussion of the smart home types, related services and benefits. After outlining the current state of smart home benefits, the review discusses the challenges and barriers to smart home implementation. This review concludes by providing suggestions for future research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2019,138,,,,,,139,154,,10.1016/j.techfore.2018.08.015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.08.015,,,,Business; Regional & Urban Planning,,Business & Economics; Public Administration,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research bridges together three important frameworks - the technology readiness index (TRI) 2.0, consumer engagement, and perceived risk and trust - to understand consumers' intentions to adopt smart home technology. We examine both direct and indirect effects, with results demonstrating the model explains 77% variance of consumers' imagined engagement with smart home technology and 74% variance of intentions to adopt; hence, our model has greater predictive power than others proposed in the literature. Theoretically and managerially, we demonstrate a new pathway to consumers' adoption of smart home technology in two ways. First, we depict the impact of consumers' general perceptions of technology (TRI) on opinions and imagined engagement experiences with smart home technology. Second, we show how opinions and imagined experiences with smart home technology impact their intentions to adopt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oct-13,2019,35,15-16,,,SI,,1370,1400,,10.1080/0267257X.2019.1680568,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2019.1680568,,Oct-19,,Business; Management,,Business & Economics,,,,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Little is known about how security risk perceptions influence householders' decisions to adopt smart home devices. In order to examine how perceptions of security risks influence intentions to use smart home devices, we test a new model of how perceived security risk affects intention to use smart devices. This model draws on the reasoned action approach from social psychology and proposes that security risk perceptions have an indirect effect on smart home adoption decisions by influencing cognitions that have a more immediate, effect on adoption intentions. The results demonstrated that perceived security risk does have an effect on intentions to use smart home devices and both attitude to use of smart home devices and perceived control over secure use of these devices play a role in this effect, confirming the value of modelling perceived risks as determinants of more direct cognitive antecedents of consumer intentions. We also investigated the role of age and education in smart home adoption decisions and found that older and more highly educated people are more likely to take their own assessments of security risk into account when they make decisions about adoption of smart home devices. Given the role of perceived security risk in influencing consumers' intentions to use smart home devices, enabling, influencing, and guiding consumers to develop the knowledge and skills they need for secure use of smart home devices is of particular importance. The findings of this study suggest several paths of action for information security professionals to achieve this. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
